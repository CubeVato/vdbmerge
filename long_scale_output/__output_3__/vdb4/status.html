* Vdbench status

* The objective of this file is to contain easily parseable information about the current state of Vdbench.
* This then can serve as an 'official' interface for any software monitoring Vdbench.
* Each line of output will be immediately flushed to the file system, making its content accessible by any monitoring program.
